# HoleIo
This is a prototype with the core gameplay of https://holeio.com/ type of games. Prototype was created as as an exercise and thus has very limited graphics, no sounds, no side-features. It's a work in progress project and I will implement more features as time allows it. 

Code features:

    State machine for easy level switching and initializing/resetting systems

    Interfaces for items that require runtime initialization
    
    Easy to extend base items
    
    Event actions for most items interactions

Scalability features:

    Scriptables for each item for easy customization
    
    Prefabs + variants for each item & UI
    
    Main scene does not require changes when new levels are added

ToDos:

    Allow players/enemies to interact with each other
    
    Create main UI
    
    Improve existing UI
    
    Implement sound system
    
    Implement minimal save system for level/sublevel
